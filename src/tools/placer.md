# Placer

The Placer is a tool for placing bricks.

## Getting Started

Grab some bricks from the Catalog (default key is B). Once you've done that, you can just simply click to place a brick!

The placer also allows row dragging in a direction. Just **hold left click** and drag to a direction that you want to place bricks in a row.

## Temporary bricks

You can copy bricks by middle clicking. This allows you to plant the copied brick (as a temp. brick) as long as you do not choose any other bricks in the tray.

## Default Keybindings

|Action|Keybinding|Functionality|
|---|---|---|
|Add Brick as Temp Brick|Middle Click **(while placer is equipped)**|Copies a brick and puts it into your tray as a temporary brick.|

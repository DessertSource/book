# Main Menu

**The Main Menu is central to everything that you want to do inside Brickadia.**

On the top right corner, you will see your own Brickadia user name. From there, you can log out of your current account and log in with a different account.

This is where you see blogs for the game. The Brickadia blog is known for updates and developer logs which document the progress of the game.

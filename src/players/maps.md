# Maps

There are currently a total of 4 maps in the game. You can select one of them from the "Start A Game" menu, or the "Edit Game" menu. Each map has different settings that may not be interchangeable with other maps at all.

```admonish tip
Label your [Presets]() according to the map name. This makes them easier to find when loading map presets.

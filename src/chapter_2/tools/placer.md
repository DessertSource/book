# Placer

![Placer](../../assets/chapter_2/tools/placer.png)

The Placer is a tool for placing bricks.

## Getting Started

Grab some bricks from the Catalog (default key is <kbd>B</kbd>). Once you've done that, you can just simply click to place a brick!

The placer also allows row dragging in a direction. Just **hold left click** and drag to a direction that you want to place bricks in a row.

## Temporary bricks

You can copy bricks by middle clicking. This allows you to place the brick like any other.

Copying can be done in two ways:
- As a temporary brick. The copied brick type will remain selected in the quickbar until you switch to something else.
- As a new quickbar brick (hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>). The copied brick type will be added to the end of your quickbar, like bricks chosen from within the catalog are.

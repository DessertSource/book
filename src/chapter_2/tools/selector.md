# Selector

![Selector](../../assets/chapter_2/tools/selector.png)

The Selector is a tool for selecting many bricks at once. Currently, you can delete many bricks, cut brick selections, copy and paste brick selections from this tool.

## Getting Started
There are a few ways to select bricks with this tool. This includes:
- Clicking a brick with the tool and resizing the selection box with the handles.
- Clicking a brick with the tool, and then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-clicking another brick to expand the selection box.

For reference, this is what the selection box and its adjustment handles looks like.

You can also adjust the selection box more precisely (under the size of a stud) by holding the **Fine Selection** keybinding.

## Deleting, Cutting, Copying and Pasting Selections
These actions with the selector all use the standard PC keybindings, although there's an additional keybinding to retain ownership when pasting bricks called **Advanced Paste Selection**.

# Installation

Brickadia has a launcher that will update the game for you, so you'll only need to install it once.

## Windows

Download the Windows installer from [the download page] and run it.

Windows SmartScreen may say that "Windows protected your PC" because the installer has not been run by enough users. To continue, click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

You'll get a shortcut to start Brickadia on your desktop, and several others in your start menu.

## Linux

### Debian/Ubuntu

Download the `brickadia-launcher.deb` package from [the download page].

On most distributions, you should be able to open it to install it. If not, run this command in a terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install path/to/brickadia-launcher.deb
```

Application entries will be installed for Brickadia.

### Other

An official package is not available for any other distributions yet, but you can download an archive of the launcher that should work on most Linux distributions, provided that you find the dependencies.

Download the `brickadia-launcher.tar.xz` archive from [the download page]. Extract it with file manager, and run the `brickadia-launcher` file to start the game.

In Brickadia, presets are everywhere.

**This list is not exhaustive.**

## Presets Menu

The Presets menu is accessible at any given point when it's possible to save configurations as presets.

Click any preset to load it.

2. Overwrite - Click this yellow button to overwrite the preset with your current configuration.

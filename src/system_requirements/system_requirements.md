# System Requirements

Brickadia's requirements are only a rough estimate of what your real-world performance would be like on the game itself. Therefore, you won't always be able to run Brickadia on every server. Different servers call for varying levels of hardware performance.

The game supports Nvidia's DLSS upscaling - which means you can render the game at much less performance cost, the main trade-off being the image quality compared to native resolution.

Apple macOS and ARM processors are not officially supported at this point in time.

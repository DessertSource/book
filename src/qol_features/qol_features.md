# Quality of Life features
Brickadia has many quality of life features to make a lot of common things in the game easier.

1. [Catalog](catalog/catalog.md) - A user interface where you get your bricks or weapons from.
2. [Presets](presets/presets.md) - A feature that's almost everywhere. Very useful for palettes, graphics settings, and more.
3. [Quickbar](quickbar/quickbar.md) - Your main quickbar in Brickadia.
